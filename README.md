2014 World Cup Pool
=================

Description
-----------------

This is a simple pool created with Mongo, Express, Angular and Node. The project is live at: http://mundialbrasil.herokuapp.com/

One amazing stat is that during the world cup those 45 users generated around 18k page views.

As a base to the project I used this awesome hackathon starter: https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter
